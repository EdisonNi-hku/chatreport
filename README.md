# chatreport
Github implementation of CHATREPORT. This is a snapshot of the v1.0 backend of our [web application](https://reports.chatclimate.ai/) on 2023.07.28.

## Directories
- annotated_data: annotation results of our human evaluation
  - chatgpt/gpt-4_results.json: ChatGPT/GPT-4's outputs on sampled reports. The JSON object contains five fields for each Q/A pairs:
    - Question: the TCFD question
    - Answer: ChatReport's answer to the question
    - Relevant Sources: sources attributed by the model
    - Irrelevant Sources: sources not cited by the answer
    - Fake Source: whether the model makes up a non-existing source
  - chatgpt/gpt-4_annotation_zip: our annotations on ChatGPT/GPT-4's outputs
- generated_data
  - analysis_reports.zip: a collection of 1015 analysis reports generated by CHATREPORT about NYSE companies.
- code
  - auto_prompt_engineer.py: the script for transferring experts' feedback to prompt engineering.
  - app.py: the script handling application run
  - document.py: the script handling PDF reading and retrieval
  - reader.py: TCFD questions & conformity analyses
  - user_qa.py: the script handling customized analyses through question answering

## Usage
Set up the environment
```shell
conda create --name chatreport python=3.10
conda activate chatreport
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Modify `OPENAI_API_KEYS` in `apikey.ini`, you could fill in multiple api key like below
```python
OPENAI_API_KEYS = ['sk-XXX', 'sk-XXX']
```

2. Analyze a given report, for example: NYSE_SNE_2018.pdf
```commandline
python app.py --pdf_path NYSE_SNE_2018.pdf
```
- Analysis report will be stored at "NYSE_SNE_2018.html"
- Answers to TCFD bullet points will be stored at "data/answers/NYSE_SNE_2018.json"
- Assessments w.r.t. TCFD guidelines will be stored at "data/assessment/NYSE_SNE_2018.json"
- Basic info will be stored at "data/basic_info/NYSE_SNE_2018.json"
- The original PDF will be stored at "data/pdf/NYSE_SNE_2018.pdf"
- Embedding/vector database will be stored at "data/vector_db/NYSE_SNE_2018/". When the report is queried again, there's no need to re-embed the vector DB.

3. Conduct customized Question Answering
```shell
python app.py --pdf_path NYSE_SNE_2018.pdf --user_question "What is the level of cheap talk in the report?" --answer_length 50
```
- user_question takes the user's question
- answer_length specifies the length of generation (we recommend 50)
- Questions, answers, sources, pages, and answer length will be appended to "data/user_qa/NYSE_SNE_2018.jsonl" (lines of JSONs)
